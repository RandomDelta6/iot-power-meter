# Iot Enabled Power Meter
Client server model for real-time monitoring of power usage aimed to simplify and modernise power usage readings and subsequent billing. Server backend handled by Firebase and Frontend made as a dynamic web app with angular framework. This project aims to elevate the process of power metering to modern connected standards and is primarily aimed towards power utility companies such that they may modernise their metering devices and enable them to be connected to the internet, allowing realtime monitoring and other advanced features like automated billing, remote disconnection, power outage detection and much more!  
The primary focus points of this project is simplicity, ease of installation of module, cost efficiency and rich user experience.
